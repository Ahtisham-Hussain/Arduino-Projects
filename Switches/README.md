# Switches
Switches are used to turn devices on or off, such as a room light or an electrical appliance, and when sending a signal, such as pressing a particular key on a keyboard. Switches can also be used to control devices; a device is on when the switch is initially pressed or while the switch is pressed. The metal contacts of switches can bounce when the switch is pressed, which could repeatedly turn a device on and off again. Switch 
bouncing can be controlled using software or by hardware, which is called debouncing a switch.
