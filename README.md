# Arduino
The Arduino Uno R3 (see Figure 1-1) contains the ATmega328P microcontroller to carry out programmed instructions and memory to store data. The Arduino is powered through a DC input or a USB connection, which is also used to upload instructions and communicate with a computer or laptop. An ATmega16U2 chip manages USB (Universal Serial Bus) to serial communication.

The power pins allow 5V (5 volts) or 3.3V and ground (GND) to connect other devices. Pins 0 and 1 are for transmitting and receiving serial data from other devices. Pins 2 to 13 are digital input and output, which input or output 5V for a digital one or 0V for a digital zero. Several output pins vary the time that a pin state is 5V to emulate voltages between 0V and 5V.

The analog pins, A0 to A5, measure voltages between 0V and 5V and convert analog signals to digital values (ADC). Pins A4 and A5 can also communicate with other devices, as can pins 10 to 13, but using different communication systems, I2C and SPI respectively, than the USB connection. Three LEDs (light-emitting diode) indicate power (ON), transmitting (TX), and receiving (RX), with a fourth LED connected to pin 13. The Reset button is used to restart the microcontroller.
