# Sensors
Sensors can be connected to the Arduino to measure aspects of the environment with sensor information displayed on the serial monitor or on the serial plotter. The Arduino can perform an instruction depending 
on the sensor signal being above or below a given threshold, such as turning on a light when a room is dark. This session describes several sensors with accompanying sketches to demonstrate uses of the sensors. 
In subsequent seesion, projects include one or more sensors.
