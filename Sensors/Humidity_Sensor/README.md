# Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor measures temperatures between 0°C and 50°C and relative humidity between 20% and 90%. Measurements are taken every second, with an accuracy of ±2°C for temperature and ±5% for relative humidity. At a relative humidity of 0%, the air is completely dry, and at 100% condensation occurs.The DHT11 sensor is supplied as a unit or mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) that includes a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between the signal and 5V connections. Connection pins for the DHT11 unit or PCB-mounted DHT11 are different, A 10kΩ pull-up resistor should be connected between the signal and 5V pins of the DHT11 unit.
